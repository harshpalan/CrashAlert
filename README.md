# Crash-Alert

An application made as college project to detect falling of person based on accelometer and gyroscope readings. The application also sends an SMS alert to the emergency contacts added in the app. The GPS coordinates and a link with list of the hospitals around the location is sent in the message. There's a toast message that is displayed before the message is sent in case of false triggers (like phone falling from desk or hand while walking) and to cancel the alert message.
